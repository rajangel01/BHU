create an array in python of 5x80
  generate random value between 0 to 3
  check every value in matrix
  if random generated value is 0 then replace them with a new random generated value between 0 and 39
  if 1 then 40 to 59
  if 2 then 60 to 79
  else 80 to 95

calculate average of each row
  generate heatmap of the matrix
